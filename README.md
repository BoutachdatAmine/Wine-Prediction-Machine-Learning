# AI: Red wine quality prediction

The purpose of this assignment is to predict wine quality based on its physical characteristics. The dataset is provided in the accompanying file 'winequality-red.csv'. A full description of the data set can be found in the file 'metadata.txt'.

To predict the wine quality I will train various ML models such as: Decision tree classifier, Random forest classifier and Gaussian naive bayes. The pattern that I'll follow while working with the ML models is the pattern recommended by Kaggle which is the following: 
1. Define a model: Choose the best suited model
2. Fit the model: Fed the model with sufficient data to learn from
3. Make predictions: Generalize the algorithm so that it can be appplied to data that is never seen before
4. Validate the model: Measure the quality of your model
